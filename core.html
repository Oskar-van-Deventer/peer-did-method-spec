<h2>Core Characteristics</h2>
<section>
    <h3>Namestring</h3>
    <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>peer</code></p>
    <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer:</code>.
        Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
        is the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">namespace specific identifier specified below</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Early feedback on this method suggested that we embed it beneath the namespace of a particular
        blockchain, as in <code>did:sov:peer</code> or <a target="_blank"
        href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-veres-one/#veres-one-did-format"><code>did:v1:nym</code></a>.
        However, this DID method is not captive to any particular blockchain, does not take its resolution rules
        from a parent method, and does not require anchoring or reference to a blockchain to be valid.
        Furthermore, any direct or indirect anchoring of a peer DID to a specific blockchain is driven by
        circumstance and changeable at any time. For example, a peer DID could specify that it is using
        a dead drop on blockchain 1, then change to blockchain 2, then change to blockchains 3 and 4 at
        the same time. Therefore, "peer" belongs at the top of the DID namespace. How this method may be
        used with various blockchains is discussed <a href="#grafting">later</a>.

    <h3>Target System(s)</h3>
    <p>This DID method applies to any identity management implementation that meets the following two
        requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Generation Algorithm</em> &mdash; The DIDs are created using the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">
            algorithm described below</a>, endowing them with properties vital to trust between peers that is not
            dependent on a central source of truth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Protocol</em> &mdash; The metadata for DIDs (what would be stored in an on-chain DID doc in other methods)
            is communicated and maintained as described in the <a href="#protocols">Protocols</a> section.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h3>
    <p>The Peer DID scheme is defined by the following ABNF (see [[RFC5234]] for syntax)</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>
            peer-did = "did:peer:" version "-" idstring<br>
            version = "1"<br>
            idstring = multibase multihash<br>
            multibase = "f"</code> <span style="color:green"># See hex in
                <a target="multibase" href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase">multibase spec</a></span><br>
        <code>multihash = "1220" restofhash</code> <span style="color:green"># See sha256+hex in
                <a target="multihash" href="https://multiformats.io/multihash/">multihash spec</a></span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Peer DIDs use an underlying number with high entropy, called the <dfn>numeric basis</dfn>, as the
        source of their uniqueness. This version of the spec (<code>version</code>
        == <code>1</code>) generates the numeric basis from a hash of the initial content
        of a DID doc (see next section). Subsequent versions of the spec may describe
        additional generation methods as needed.</p>
    <p>This <em>numeric basis</em> is encoded as a hash using the
        <a target="multihash" href="https://multiformats.io/multihash/">multihash prefix</a>
        for sha256+hex: "1220". Although this prefix is redundant today, a multihash prefix is used
        so that a different digest or encoding may be selected in the future.</p>
    <p>The multihash value is preceded by a <a target="multibase"
            href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase">multibase prefix</a> that tells how to
        interpret the multihash that follows. Since the multihash value is hex in
        this version of the spec, <code>multibase</code> is always "f" today; if the
        multihash variant changes in the future, <code>multibase</code> may change, too.
    <p>
    <p class="note">Peer DIDs MUST be compared according to whatever case-sensitivity is implied by the
        hash encoding they use. Hex is not case-sensitive, but if a future version of the spec
        uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding">base58</a> or
        base64 [[RFC4648]] encoding, values will be case-sensitive. Therefore, routines that handle
        peer DIDs MUST NOT normalize case unless they take into account the specific hash encoding.</p>

    <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
    <p>The unique <em>numeric basis</em> underlying a Peer DID MUST be generated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a <dfn>genesis version</dfn> of JSON text of the DID doc for the DID. The genesis version MUST
            include enough keys and <a target="#authorization">authorization</a> that the genesis version of the doc
            can be signed, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during initial DID exchange. It SHOULD also include
            enough state that subsequent evolutions to the doc are authorized; otherwise, the doc is a dead end.
            It MUST NOT include the DID itself (either the root <code>id</code> property or its value). This
            lets the doc be created without knowing the DID's value in advance.
            Suppressing the DID value creates a <dfn>stored variant</dfn> of peer DID doc data,
            as opposed to the <dfn>resolved variant</dfn> that would have an actual DID value in the root <code>id
            </code> property. (In either the stored or resolved variant of the doc, anywhere else that the DID value
            would appear, it should appear as a relative reference rather than an absolute value. For example, each
            <code>controller</code> property of a <a href="#publickey">publicKey that is owned by this DID would say
                <code>"controller": "#id"</code></a>.)
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the SHA256 hash of the bytes of the <a>stored variant</a> of the <a>genesis version</a> of the
            DID doc, and make this value the new DID's <a>numeric basis</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By basing the numeric value of the DID on the <a>genesis version</a> of the DID doc, the DID can begin its
        lifecycle with any number of keys and endpoints, and when the doc is signed or auth-encrypted by one
        of the keys, the recipient can know it has not been modified since creation. This guarantees the
        initial integrity of the DID's chain of custody.</p>
    <p>By hashing the stored variant, we avoid the circular problem of including the DID in the data that's being
        hashed. This means that a peer DID doc must be resolved by converting a <a>stored variant</a> of DID doc
        data into a <a>resolved variant</a> by inserting the value of the DID being resolved, during resolution.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>^did:peer:1-f1220[a-f0-9]{8,40}$</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>did:peer:1-f1220479cbc07c3f991725836a3aa2a581ca2029198aa420b9d99bc0e131d9f3e2cbe</code>
    </blockquote>
